# Sonata

> **Warning:** This project is incomplete and not production ready.

Sonata is a code-first workflow orchestration platform built with Elixir and
Phoenix. It enables creating, managing, and executing multi-stage workflows
defined through code.

## Why does this exist?

I wanted to create a workflow orchestration tool where all orchestration is
defined as source-controlled code.

## Features

- **Code-First**: All workflows are defined as code and source-controlled with
  Git.
- **~~Serverless~~ One Server**: Run all your workflows on a single server.
- **More**: This project is largely unimplemented. I'll add features to this
  list when they become extant.
