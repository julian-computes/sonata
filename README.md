# Sonata

> **Warning:** This project is incomplete and not production ready.

Sonata is a code-first workflow orchestration platform built with Elixir and Phoenix. It enables creating,
managing, and executing multi-stage workflows through code rather than visual editors.

## Why does this exist?

I wanted to create a workflow orchestration tool that prioritized source control over visual editing.

## Features

* **Code-First**: All workflows are defined as code and source-controlled with Git.
* **~~Serverless~~ One Server**: Run all your workflows on a single server.
* **Much more**: This project is largely unimplemented. I'll add features to this list when they become extant.
